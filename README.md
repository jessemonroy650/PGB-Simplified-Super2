# PGB-Simplified-Super2
A Super Simple example App for Android which compiles on *Phonegap Build* that updates one HTML page app with an image and text.

This App is the same as [https://github.com/jessemonroy650/PGB-Simplified-Super PGB-Simplified-Super] with one major acception, it places the images, css, and javascript in their own directories. Changes to index.html in the Content-Security-Policy to deal with this.

It also adds another line of text to validate that Cordova has loaded.
